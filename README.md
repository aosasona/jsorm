# jsorm

A minimal JSON formatter in Gleam and HTMX

## Note

There are still a lot of things I'd love to do here but I can't for now because I need to focus on working on my main project, so I have implemented the basic minimum functionalities I needed.

## I was promised HTMX and Hyperscript, why do I see fetch?

Good question, I either wanted to use my tiny toast library or I was too lazy to do it all server-side (most likely the former)
